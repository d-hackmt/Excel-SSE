Here you will see an excel file preview of monthly income and expenses. You need to create a similar-looking excel file. 

Keep the following in mind:

) Use separate table objects for income and expenses.
) For totals in both tables, you can use the inbuilt Excel table total feature.
) Use conditional formatting to highlight monthly savings when they are below the monthly savings target that is specified at the top.
) You can add additional income and expense items. Also, fill out your own real expenses in this sheet on an ongoing basis so that you can track your monthly savings.
) In case you don't have an income right now, do this for your friend or family member.

All the best :)
